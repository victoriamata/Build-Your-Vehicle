# Build-Your-Vehicle

## Description
This project is a typescript command line application that builds three different types of vehicles, or allows the user to select an existing vehicle. The user is then asked if they would like to perform certain actions with their vehicle, as many times as they would like to, until the user decides to exit this application. After building this project, I learned how to work with existing code to run typescript applications.
