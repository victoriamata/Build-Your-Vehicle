# Build-Your-Vehicle

## Description
This project is a typescript command line application that builds cars, motorbikes, or trucks, as well as selects existing vehicles. This application interacts with the user, receiving their response, and documenting the details. The user is then asked if they would like to perform certain actions with their vehicle, as many times as they would like to, until the user decides to exit this application.
